#What is Mink?

Mink's main focus is to assist with building and transitioning between the build step [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) provides. Mink is still in development and in the end, we would like to give the users more flexibility. This means that you can refactor your application with no coding required yourself. We'd also like to give an option to only provide you with the Webpack configuration, as pre-integrated React and fellow libraries are not everyones choice. For now, we are focusing on getting the tool up and running, and we will add flags and options for this later. 

#Usage

##Building applications: 

`mink -u`

##Refactoring current application:

`mink -r`

#Contribute

To contribute, please check out [what we are missing!](https://github.com/ev1stensberg/mink) There is still much left in order for Mink to be fully functional, so Pull Requests are warmly welcome.
